        <h1>Report for CM 1040 Finals</h1>
        <h2>By: Lien Hui Xuan</h4>
        <section>
            <h3>Introduction:</h3>
            <p>The essential story told from my site consist of news and global happenings from all over the world.
                I chose to implement a newspaper structure where there consist different categories and a page dedicated to reader's contribution where they can 
                share pictures that they have taken. This encourages interaction between readers and the website and is not a
                passive interaction where we provide articles and information and readers just read.
                Readers can interact with us by sharing their pictures or contacting us via our hotline or email address available at every page. 
                By including the photography page, we hope to increase the presence of art scene and bring attention to the arts, specifically
                in the photography. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The articles are specially curated for readers, there are bite-size content to pique reader's interest and allow them
                to have a brief understanding of the content before delving into the individual article pages where in-depth information are included.
                <br>
                <br>
                The five pages that I have created are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Landing page; index.html - Consist of trending articles, mix of different categories</li>
                    <li>Singapore page; Singapore.html - Consist of articles relating to Singapore</li>
                    <li>World page; World.html - Consist of articles all over the world</li>
                    <li>Photography; Photography.html - Consist of picture contributions from readers</li>
                    <li>Article; Article.html - Consist of an in-depth article regarding DodgeyCoinz</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Inspiration:</h3>
            <p>The three things I got inspired from are <a href="https://www.ft.com/">Financial Times</a>, 
                <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/">Straits Times</a> and 
                <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash.</a>
            </p>
            <p>I enjoy the straightforward layout and minimalist colour palette provided by both Financial Times and Straits Times. I took note of their minimalist style and incorporated
                it into my page. For Unsplash, I got to explore many different pictures provided by photographers all over the world and got inspired by the artwork and page layout which
                needed no further explanation on the page buttons and functions. I was able to navigate smoothly throughout these three websites which is an experience I want to bring 
                to readers/ users of my site.
            </p>
        </section>

            <h3>Accessibility</h3>
            <p>Three ways my site is accessible are</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The page is designed for devices of different screen sizes, the units used for text and spacings are "rem" and "vh" which are <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.php">relative length units.</a> 
                    The sizes adjusts and accomodates accordingly to the device's size allowing users to view comfortably.
                </li>
                <li>Users who are unable to access strong internet connection to browse the website may not be able to load the pictures and experience the loss of 
                    visual context. There are alternative texts available that communicates the picture's content to them. Thus even with slow or bad Internet connection, they are able to have an idea of the picture.
                </li>
                <li>Users who are unsure how to navigate can look to the visual cues such as differences in colour and the icons to navigate. For example the categories are in white colour to stand out and provide a colour contrast to users. Also, the arrows and pointers allow user to change the slide show image without waiting for them to change automatically to suit their reading needs.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Three ways I have considered usability</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>My website has been structured in a clear manner which allows user to navigate with ease and not overloaded by the informations and functions.
                    For instance, the categories and hamburger menu button have been placed at a position that is visible and accessible by the user.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The buttons and pointers that I have included are self-explanatory and does not cause unwanted confusion for users. For instance, within
                    the carousels there are "arrows" that allow users to go to the next slide or return to the previous slide. The "hamburger menu" which generally
                    provides more options to users are also included to give user's the flexibility of choice to discover more about the page and navigate with ease.
                    In addition, the logo button at the top left is also clickable and users can click on the button to return to the homepage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The design of my site conveys the content of each page promptly allowing the user to understand the content of the page at first glance. The contents does not contain confusing or distracting visuals that takes their attention away from the articles. Users are able to absorb and ascertain the page's information within the first thirty seconds of viewing the page's content.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Learning:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>I learnt how to adapt codes that I sourced online to fit my pages. I am able to modify the code and fix the code in the event that it breaks or
                    does not work. I find this learning to be extremely useful as being able to understand the code and reproducing it will save me time and allow
                    me to research more on other aspects for my website such as the design and responsiveness.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I learnt how to properly utilised the units length provided by CSS properly as previously I was constrained to using "px" which 
                    was absolute and did not my page elements to resize accordingly. This enhanced my web development process and allowed me to create a 
                    responsive webpage catering to devices of different sizes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I learnt how to effectively and efficiently use Bootstrap to customise and design my page. Bootstrap's classes and built-in structures had 
                    been very helpful in the creation of my webpage. Their intuitive class names such as "bg-black" and "text-white" enabled me to understand and 
                    use them throughout my HTML.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Evaluation I:</h3>
            <p>I think the aspects of my work that were particularly successful was the ability to tap on Bootstrap for my website creation. Being able to grasp
                the concept of Bootstrap allowed me to adjust the components of my elements with ease and also reduce the use of CSS. I am able to make changes to the 
                style of the items using the classes and this is extremely helpful is keeping my CSS neat and tidy. As most of the class names for Bootstrap is self-explanatory, 
                I am able to understand their functionalities from their class names. Also, the ability to tap on existing resources to make my site more vibrant and allow others
                to perceive it as dynamic allowed me to better design my project.
            </p>
            <h3>Evaluation II</h3>
            <p>I believe I can provide more interactive features and improve the overall aesthetic of the site in my next project. I want to be able to give my readers more freedom to customise
                and personalise their readings. I would include a filter that will allow them to include articles of different tags that suits their taste, perhaps an article that consist the 
                element of both "technology" and "finance" where they can read on an article that dives into both of these topics. There are several functionality and aesthetic improvements that 
                I can make to better the experience for users such as making the information more dynamic with live weather and time information with the help of JavaScript, filter functions
                and other functions that I can explore and implement to improve user experience.
